## Abstract

Urban Green Spaces (UGS) provide critical ecosystem services including temperature regulation, pollution reduction, 
and mental health benefits. While their unequal distribution is globally documented, Latin American research typically 
relies on static accessibility metrics within single metropolitan areas. This overlooks the dynamic social usage of these 
spaces across varying climates. To address this gap, we integrated Landsat 8 remote sensing, census data, and massive 
mobile phone records (XDR) to analyze green space segregation across six Chilean conurbations. These cities span a 
latitudinal gradient from Antofagasta (23°S) to Puerto Montt (41°S). We quantified vegetation vigor 
using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and characterized neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) using 
a multidimensional index. We also calculated social entropy from mobile records to dynamically measure daily social 
mixing within parks. Our results reveal a persistent ``green divide'' regardless of local climate. Parks in lower-SES 
neighborhoods are significantly less green and exhibit lower social mixing than those in affluent areas. Conversely, 
parks in affluent neighborhoods attract a more diverse user base throughout the day. These findings indicate that 
structural and administrative factors are the primary drivers of green inequality rather than climatic constraints. 
Equitable urban planning must evolve beyond simple provision targets to prioritize the quality and social integration 
capacity of urban green spaces.


## Repository overview

This repository contains the complete analytical workflow used to characterize socioeconomic inequalities in urban green spaces across six Chilean conurbations.

The pipeline reconstructs the methodology used in the manuscript, including:

- preparation of spatial datasets;
- reconstruction and validation of NDVI metrics;
- reconstruction and validation of ISMT metrics;
- reconstruction of entropy-based segregation analyses;
- statistical analyses (ANOVA and Tukey);
- generation of the main figures;
- generation of Table 1;
- supplementary analyses.

## Workflow

The analytical workflow is organized into six sections:

1. **Data loading** – Imports all spatial, environmental, mobility, and analytical datasets.

2. **Data preparation** – Reconstructs and validates park attributes, ISMT, NDVI, entropy, and analytical classifications.

3. **Results** – Reproduces all statistical analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.

4. **Table 1** – Reconstructs the study-area summary table from the original datasets.

5. **Appendix** – Generates the supplementary statistical analyses (ANOVA, Tukey tests, and dendrograms).

6. **Supplementary material** – Includes the official cartographic products and supplementary datasets accompanying the manuscript.

Original mobile phone XDR records cannot be redistributed because they are subject to third-party licensing and data-sharing agreements. The original public park database can be obtained from the source referenced above but is not included in this repository to reduce repository size. Processed datasets required to reproduce the analyses are provided instead.
